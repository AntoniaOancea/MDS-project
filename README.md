# MDS-project

## As an app user, I want to be able to search for recipes that use specific ingredients that I have, so that I can find new and creative ways to use them.

## As an app user, I want to be able to generate a list of other ingredients that I need for a recipe, based on the ingredients I already have at home, so that I can make sure I have everything I need before I start cooking.

## As an admin or user of the recipe app, I want to be able to add new recipes to the app, so that users have access to a wide variety of recipes.

## As a user of the recipe app, I want to be able to leave reviews for recipes that I have tried, so that I can share my experience with other users and help them decide whether or not to try the recipe themselves.

## As a user of the recipe app, I want to be able to upload pictures of the food I've made, so that I can share my creations with others and inspire them to try new recipes.
